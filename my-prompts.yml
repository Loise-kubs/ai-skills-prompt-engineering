Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of the initial phase of the WhatsApp for Business project, I am currently conducting a thorough requirement analysis to ensure we align the solution with both business objectives and technical feasibility. To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your assistance in providing further clarity on a few key areas.

Specifically, I would like to understand:

The intended use cases for the WhatsApp platform (e.g., customer service, marketing, internal communication).
Whether the preference is for an API-based solution or a standard business account, and the rationale behind this choice.
Any compliance, data privacy, or integration requirements that should be considered.
The expected user base and volume of interactions to help assess scalability needs.
Having this information will enable me to define the scope more accurately and collaborate with the relevant teams to identify the most suitable technical and operational approach.

Please let me know a convenient time if you'd prefer to discuss this in a quick call. I‚Äôm happy to accommodate your schedule.

Thank you in advance for your support.

Warm regards,
Loise Kubayi
